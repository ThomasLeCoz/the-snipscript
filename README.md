# Quick description

This PHP script will allow you to automate your content curation and generate leads from your curation. It sends articles you tag to your Buffer, passing the link through Snip.ly to add a lead generating CTA in the same movement.

I wrote a detailed article about it here:

# Requirements

Here is a list of what you'll need, in addition to this script to make it work properly:
* PHP & PHP Curl module
* the buffer lib made by Little-Apps.com [here](https://www.little-apps.com/blog/2012/09/automatically-post-updates-buffer-api-php/)

You'll also need to :
1. Require access to the Snip.ly API: [click here](http://snip.ly/api/v2/)
2. Register a Buffer App : [here](https://buffer.com/developers/api)

# Warning

I'm what you might call a duct-tape developer. My stuff work but it's not the elegant poetry you might be used to on GitHub :)
